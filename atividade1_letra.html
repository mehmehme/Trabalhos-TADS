                    I'm two days into college,
                    And I'm three lectures behind,
                    There's this guy, let's name him Colin,
                    He says he wants to be mine,
                    But it doesn't really sit with me quite right,
                    Cause he doesn't really 
                    like the things i like,
                    And I keep accidentally locking myself,
                    out of my dorm in the middle of the night,
                    I wake up kinda wired,
                    And I wake up kinda cold,
                    And I wake up kinda tired,
                    But I'll just sleep in when I'm old,
                    See I don't like breaking rules,
                    But don't like doing as I'm told,
                    So I just float around 
                    and keep my head down,
                    And hope my life unfolds,
                    And everybody's telling me 
                    that I'm doing so well,
                    I try to trust them, honestly,
                    I find it hard to tell,
                    If I need work or I need rest,
                    I try my best to try my best,
                    I tell myself, I say out loud,
                    It's fine, I'll figure it all out,
                    I tend to forget,
                    I'm still only quite young,
                    In a way, this life of mine 
                    has only just begun,
                    I've got time,
                    I've got time,
                    I'm two days into college,
                    With a busy, busy mind,
                    That guy that we named Colin,
                    He's so handsome, he's so kind,
                    My friends tell me I'm crazy,
                    Say I take it way too far,
                    'Cause I told him that it's over,
                    'Cause he doesn't play guitar,
                    I'm only two days into college,
                    And my bedroom is a mess,
                    There's just so much that I want to do,
                    That I have not done yet,
                    There's just so much that I want to say,
                    And far too little breath,
                    Oh, my mind it runs so far away,
                    It's easy to forget,
                    That to everybody else, 
                    it looks like I'm doing so well,
                    I try to see it, honestly,
                    I find it hard to tell,
                    If I've done wrong or I've done right,
                    I need a good night's sleep tonight,
                    They said go out, I said alright,
                    I think I won't, I maybe might,
                    I probably should just take it slow,
                    I'll be all good,
                    But God I know,
                    The one thing that's important 
                    above everything else,
                    Is to learn not to put all this 
                    heavy pressure on myself,
                    I try believe it when I say,
                    "If it's meant to happen, 
                    it'll happen anyway",
                    I'll be fine,
                    I've got time,
                    I've got time,
                    That's where I'm at,
                    To be honest,
                    Just two days,
                    Two days into college.
